# My Projects

## RenpyTextEditor

I made a text editor for the RenPy visual novel game engine. This editor features many modern features like syntax highlighting, project management, theme support,
as well as many shortcuts dedicated to the RenPy scripting language.

## BugTrackerFlask

This WebApp is useful to track bugs and issues about a specific project. I mainly used that project to teach myself the ropes of Flask, Jinja, and to get back into
web development.

## tkinter-pp

This project is a library of widgets designed for tkinter, the default GUI toolkit of the Python programming language. It includes many utilities and widgets to simplify the production of professional GUI applications.

## rpg-text

A game engine dedicated to making text-based roleplaying games. Loosely based on Original Dungeons and Dragons rules, it features full customizability, as well as a fully fledged tkinter based frontend.

## Stillbirth

A LUA-coded game mod for the popular game "The Binding of Isaac". This mod features over 55 new items, trinkets, pills, cards, familiars and curses to play the game with.

The mod received a 5-star rating on the Steam Workshop marketplace, and was downloaded over 10,000 times.
